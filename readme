## 🔗 How to Secure Another Microservice Using This Authentication Service

This Authentication Microservice is **fully independent and reusable**.  
It **must not be modified** when integrating with other services.

This section explains **what another microservice must do** to use authentication provided by this service.

---
### 🔐 Authentication Flow

Client → Authentication Service → JWT Token
Client → Another Microservice (with JWT)

**Authorization Header Format**
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

---

### 🧩 Responsibilities of the Other Microservice

The secured microservice must:

- Read the `Authorization` header from every request  
- Extract the JWT token  
- Validate the token using:
  - the **same secret key**, or  
  - the **public key** provided by this Authentication Service  
- Allow the request **only if the token is valid**  
- Reject the request with **HTTP 401** if the token is missing or invalid  

---

### ⚙️ Security Requirements

The other microservice should:

- Be **stateless**  
- Disable **session-based authentication**  
- Disable **CSRF**  
- Use a **JWT validation filter** before request processing  

---

### ⏳ Token Validation Rules

Token validation must include:

- Signature verification  
- Token expiration check  
- Token integrity verification  

_No database lookup is required for authentication._

---

### 👥 Role & Authorization Handling

If roles or permissions are included in the JWT:

- Extract roles from the token  
- Map them to application roles  
- Protect endpoints based on roles  

---

### 🚫 Important Rules

- Do **NOT** modify this Authentication Service  
- Do **NOT** re-authenticate users in other services  
- Do **NOT** store sessions  
- Trust **only JWTs issued by this service**  

---

### ✅ Result

By following this approach:

- Authentication remains **centralized**  
- All microservices stay **independent**  
- The system remains **scalable and secure**
